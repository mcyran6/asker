## Problem Solver
This app uses the Claude API to approach problems from a research based context. The goal is to create a pipeline so it would take as input a problem statement in the form of a pdf, and output a latex document with the generated solution.
The key value proposition is the research phase, in which content relevant passages are collected and put into the context of the API to give a focus for the output.

It started because I have senioritis and this is the fun way to do my homework.
